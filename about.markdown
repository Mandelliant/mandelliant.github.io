## Anthony Mandelli

I'm a technical content marketer with experience in social media, content strategy, and analytics. Currently I work for the blockchain data provider [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io) as Community Manager. In a previous life I was a higher-ed administrator.

Topics of interest include privacy-preserving technology, digital sovereignty, distributed education, and using language to make tech more accessible.
