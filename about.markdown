## Anthony Mandelli

I'm a technical content marketer with experience in social media, content strategy, and analytics. Currently I work in the blockchain and Web3 industry. In a previous life I was a higher-ed administrator.

Topics of interest include privacy-preserving technology, digital sovereignty, distributed education, and using storytelling to make tech more accessible.
