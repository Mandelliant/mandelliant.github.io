### And so it begins

This website started off as a way to host some of my favorite written pieces that I've worked on over the years.

But I had so much fun building it (read: frustration re-acquainting myself with Jekyll), that it seemed a shame to just plop down some text and let it be.

So now it's a portfolio website that will grow and be a sandbox to play around in.

And it's going to host a blog (because everyone needs a blog or at least a podcast or newsletter).
