Why are community management roles so important?

The crypto industry changed (or at least influenced) how companies and professional organizations view their users. Customer Success has evolved significantly as a discipline over the last fifteen years as tech asserted itself as a major economic force and startup culture permeated other industries. What began largely as a support function has become a crucial part of many companies' sales processes and customer retention strategies. 

At the intersection of Customer Success and social media, companies realized their users weren't just talking to their representatives, but also _to each other_. 

Crypto is known for being fast-paced and constantly changing, with new technologies and trends emerging frequently. Building and maintaining a strong community can provide a significant advantage for crypto projects building for the long haul. 

**Community fosters innovation.** Crypto is already on the bleeding edge, and a healthy community can provide a platform for exchanging ideas, collaborating on feature development, and sharing research. Most communities are made of various stakeholders including team members, users, partners, researchers, and developers. When a community is healthy, it's a place where these different stakeholders can share ideas and find new, innovative solutions (sometimes). Projects that have strong communities can use those relationships to inform building new features or improve existing products in line with what their users want.

**Community helps built loyalty.** Crypto is a crowded industry - CoinGecko tracks [over twelve thousand different coins][coingecko]. A healthy community helps people build confidence in the tools they use and projects they support. When a company engages with its community and listens to their needs, it can create a sense of belonging and loyalty among the members. This can translate into customers being more likely to purchase the company's products, recommend them to others, and defend the company in the face of criticism. In the long run, brand loyalty can help the company build a sustainable customer base and create a competitive advantage in the market.

Thirdly, community can be a source of valuable feedback. Companies in the tech industry need to be constantly improving and evolving to stay ahead of the curve. By building a community, they can get feedback from their customers and stakeholders, which can be invaluable in helping them improve their products and services. A community can provide a platform for customers to share their opinions and suggestions, which can help the company understand their needs better. This can lead to the company developing better products, addressing customer concerns, and improving customer satisfaction.

Fourthly, community can help with recruitment and talent retention. The tech industry is highly competitive, and companies need to attract and retain top talent to succeed. Building a community can help them achieve this by creating a positive culture and environment that attracts and retains top talent. When a company has a strong community, it can provide employees with a sense of purpose, belonging, and fulfillment. This can lead to higher employee engagement, job satisfaction, and productivity. Additionally, when employees feel that their company cares about them and is invested in their success, they are more likely to stay with the company for the long term.

Fifthly, community can help companies stay up-to-date with industry trends. The tech industry is constantly evolving, and companies need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies to remain competitive. Building a community can help companies achieve this by providing a platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and learning. A community can consist of experts in the industry who can share their insights and expertise on the latest trends and technologies. This can help the company stay ahead of the curve and ensure that they are always up-to-date with the latest developments.

In conclusion, community is essential for companies in the tech industry. By building and maintaining a strong community, companies can foster innovation, build brand loyalty, receive valuable feedback, attract and retain top talent, and stay up-to-date with industry trends. In today's fast-paced and highly competitive tech industry, companies that invest in building a strong community can gain a significant advantage over their competitors. Therefore, companies in the tech industry should prioritize building a strong community to ensure their long-term success.
