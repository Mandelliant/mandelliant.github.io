## Anthony Mandelli

I'm a marketing professional with backgrounds in content strategy and production, social media, CRM systems, analytics, and digital communication. In a previous life I was a higher-ed administrator.

Topics of interest include privacy-preserving technology, digital sovereignty, distributed education, and using language to make tech more accessible.
